Project Title: Serverless Web Application on Cloud
Task Number: 1
Objective: Develop a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for dynamic functionality.
________________________________________
Project Overview:
I created a serverless web application that handles user requests using AWS Lambda for business logic, API Gateway for routing, and DynamoDB for data storage.
Steps Followed:
1.	Frontend Development:
o	Built the frontend using HTML and CSS.
o	JavaScript was used to interact with the backend via API calls.
2.	Backend Development:
o	Lambda Functions:
	Wrote functions in Python for processing logic.
	These functions were triggered by API Gateway events.
o	API Gateway Configuration:
	Set up a REST API in API Gateway.
	Configured GET and POST methods to interact with Lambda.
o	DynamoDB Integration:
	Created a DynamoDB table for storing application data.
	Implemented CRUD operations through Lambda functions.
3.	Testing and Deployment:
o	Tested the application using Postman and manual frontend testing.
o	Deployed the application using AWS services.
________________________________________
Outcome: The project was successfully completed, resulting in a fully functional serverless web application. The use of AWS services ensured that the application was scalable and easy to maintain.
